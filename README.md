## No named RPG game
This is my RPG game. I haven't thought of a name yet since I just started coding this HTML game.

## Why I'm making this game
I'm a beginner in HTML, JS and CSS, so I thought the best way to learn them is to make a fully fledged game. I have ambitious ideas for the project which I will describe here.
